# ü¶úÔ∏èüîó Chat W/ Slack Export

This repo is an implementation of a locally hosted chatbot specifically focused on question answering over a slack export using Docker.

It is derived from (hwchase17/chat-langchain) https://github.com/hwchase17/chat-langchain

Note: Most of your slack history is transmitted to OpenAI during the process of building this container.

1. Export your data from slack and place the zip file in this folder as slack-export.zip
2. Use the following command with your own OpenAI API key to build the image and calculate the document embeddings
   i. `docker build -t chat-with-slack --build-arg=OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...`
3. Run the image with this command
   i. `docker run -d -p 9000:9000/tcp chat-with-slack`
4. Connect to the app at http://127.0.0.1:9000 and ask your questions
